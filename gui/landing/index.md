For Application developers it’s became expected that they embed GPT mechanics, and market is growing as well as workforce is forced to use AI Processors more in more in daily routines, points:

- People became used to GPT flow mechanics.
- If you’re building in 2024 you expected to have GPT/AI Mechanics implemented in your application.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) applications enhancing GPT output by integrating external information retrieval widely appearing as portion of help/service desk business processes.
- Multi-step AI Processors are used by professional GPT users in their daily activities and work life.
- We believe projects driving GTP Revolution towards utilization of financial tooling of Web3 World would prevail in this cycle.

<!-- ORCHESTRATOR SECTION -->

{% capture content %}

Orchestrator is in a core of GURU Platform Ecosystem powering up all connection and financial means of GURU Network:

- Provides single execution context for variety of environments (on-chain/off-chain/user/AI interactions)
- Seamlessly orchestrate multi-steps LLM/AI models using orchestration snippets catalog
- Reuse Published BPA Definitions
- Distribute Execution when working in pair with GURU Wallet, which allows remote execution from FlowOrchestration on particular actions.
- EventBus exposed on GURU Network as an Oracle

GURU Wallet and Wallet SDK serves as a window into GURU Network participation, as a builder, user or compute node runner. Wallet SDK is the main interface to communicate with Network and control all the processes/projects attached to the account. Same time it serves as a view into GURU Network Ecosystem, like and Ecosystem App Store if you want.

- GURU Wallet SDK: Acts as an Eternal Worker for process orchestration within the GURU Network. Allowing users to orchestrate non-custodial trading mechanics.
- Orchestrated Process Execution: Seamlessly trigger actions and manage smart contracts through FlowOrchestrator integration.
- Personalized AI Processors: Deploy and control BPAs from applications catalog, as Personal Assistants for enhanced productivity across the ecosystem.
- Earn When Idle: Users contribute computational power to run AI models, selected based on device performance to fulfill SLA. Devices answer GPT Model questions during idle times, like overnight charging, earning rewards for users.
- GURU Ecosystem role: Cornerstone component in realizing Guru Labs' vision for a decentralized, efficient, and user-centric digital world.
