For Application developers it’s became expected that they embed GPT mechanics, and market is growing as well as workforce is forced to use AI Processors more in more in daily routines, points:

- People became used to GPT flow mechanics.
- If you’re building in 2024 you expected to have GPT/AI Mechanics implemented in your application.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) applications enhancing GPT output by integrating external information retrieval widely appearing as portion of help/service desk business processes.
- Multi-step AI Processors are used by professional GPT users in their daily activities and work life.
- We believe projects driving GTP Revolution towards utilization of financial tooling of Web3 World would prevail in this cycle.
