			<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>PicCraft revolutionizes the gaming experience by seamlessly integrating the physical world
with virtual economies. Using cutting-edge AI technology, players can transform real-world
objects into unique, AI-generated models, importing them into game worlds like Minecraft. Coupled with the possibility of integration with crypto wallets, PicCraft not only enhances gameplay but also pioneers a new level of crypto integration with games.</p>

					<h3>The Process</h3>
				</header>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players capture images of real-world objects, which Pixelpact.ai's
AI algorithms transform into detailed, game-ready models.</li>
					<li>These AI-generated models are imported into games as unique digital
assets and, given proper moderation, can save time on builds in Minecraft. Each model can be represented by a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) stored within wallets.</li>
					<li>An innovative tokenomics system underpins the platform, with a
minting price curve that becomes progressively steeper.</li>
                </ul>

					<h3>Benefits</h3>
				</header>
                <ul>
                    <li>By allowing importation into game worlds, players can save time on rebuilding real-world structures and also easily rebuild the same structure in multiple places, as is the case with Minecraft. </li>
					<li>Every real-world object imported has the possibility of becoming a unique digital asset, enhancing personalization and engagement.</li>
					<li>The minting price curve mechanism incentivizes players to
participate in the game's economy, promoting liquidity and trading within the game
environment.</li>
                    <li>The digital wallet plugin does more than hold assets; it's the
gateway to a comprehensive ecosystem.</li>
                </ul>

			<h2>Start Now</h2>
		</header>
		<p>You can get our plugin for Minecraft version 1.20.4 from our Spigot page.</p>
        <p>From there, after installing and using Spigot on your server, an API will open up on port 8001. From a Telegram bot, you will be able to send requests to that server after adding yourself as a Camunda user and sending a request to your server address.</p>
        <p>After you send a request with the right coordinates, you should get a structure at the coordinates in the world. Happy building!</p>
